### Abstract
The aim of this study is to develop an alternative educational robot to generally preferred ready robot kits in basic coding and robotic educations. For this purpose, easy to supply and assemble by both teachers and students, a low-cost educational robot equipped with various sensors and actuators was developed using open source Arduino microcontroller. And again with written extension by the researcher, the robot can be easily programmed as block-based in mBlock software (version 3.4.12). At time same time, the robot can run applications simultaneously without the need for compilation and upload in mBlock software Scratch mode via USB and bluetooth connection. For this purpose, Makeblock mBot serial port protocol and firmwares of Makeblock electronic modules were adapted to the robot and the robot's own firmware were created. In the development of the robot, Arduino Nano development card, bluetooth module, ultrasonic distance sensor, light sensor, sound sensor, RGB LED, buzzer, motor driver card and DC motor were used. Tested also with Arduino Uno and Arduino Mega development cards, the robot can be used in basic coding and robotic educations and can be developed by adding different sensors.
